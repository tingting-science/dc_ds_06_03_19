### Open the CO2 notebook we have worked on 

#### The goal is to use the month and year attributes/features as a categorical variable to use in multiple regression
- Do you understand why it's problematic to leave it as an integer type? 

#### 1. Load the co2 data 

#### 2. Follow all steps from previous notebook to get it to the state where we have 4 columns (year, month, day, CO2)


#### 3. Transform month and year to categorical variables 

`Use pd.get_dummies`

#### 4. For practice purposes only let's create a function that gets a df and a column name and outputs a normalized column
 - a column of our choice --> here we'll test the CO2 column 
`use the np.mean function and np.std `
 
#### 5. Push all your changes to github

#### 6. Open the suicide_rates file and notebook 

#### 7. Apply normalization and dummies wherever seems appropriate to you to prepare the data for some analysis - this is a discussion to be done in pairs or triplets.

#### 8. Push any changes to github

#### 9. Send your Coach the last value of normalized C02 you have recieved
