### Import packages 
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 `
`import seaborn as sns`

`import numpy as np`

### 1. Create fake data from normal distribution with 100 observations

`use numpy random.normal`

### 2. Plot a histogram to see the distribution using matplotlib
![](./plots/hist_matplot.png)


### 3. Switch to seaborn and add a smooth distribution line on top of histogram 
![](./plots/hist_sns.png)


### 4. Add titles to plots and save them in your visualizations folder using python commands

### 5. Let's create fake linear regression data
- create weights (only one here!) and noise (give 0.1 as std for noise) from random normal as well 
- apply y = w * x + noise 


### 6. Create a scatter plot of x to y

### 7. Plot the regression line

![](./plots/linear_reg_line.png)

### 8. Calculate the mean squared error 

### 9. Plot the noise with respect to the predictors - this is a plot to check 
-  If the x's are independent from the errors - so for linear regression model to hold we need it to look like a scattered cloud

### 10. Push all to your github branch

### 11. [optional] Create functions for the different steps in this warm-up (e.g. def x_from_standard_normal)

### 12. [optional] Create a new array the same size as x and append them together                - Adjust y equation accordingly
