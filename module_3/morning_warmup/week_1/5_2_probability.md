### Let's practice some probability!

1. Calculate the number of possible 5 card hands in a 52-card deck (combinations).

2. What is the probability of rolling a sum of 9 with 2 dice?

3. What is the probability of getting at least 1 tail if you flip 3 coins in a row?

4. We have two identical boxes. The first has 8 black balls and 4 white balls. The second has 2 black balls and 2 white balls. A) If a box is chosen at random, then the ball is chosen randomly, what is the chance that we draw a black ball? B) If we draw a black ball, what is the probability it is from the first box?
