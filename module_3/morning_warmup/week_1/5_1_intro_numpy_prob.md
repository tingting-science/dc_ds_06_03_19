### Let's use numpy to answer a probability question by creating a simulation!

1. We have a box that contains 40 red balls and 60 white balls. What is the probability to pick a red ball 3 times in a row with replacement (calculated theoretically)?

2. Now let's answer the same question using a simulation that runs 1\_000, 10\_000, and 100\_000 times and counts how many of those times we draw 3 red balls in a row. Hint: use np.random.rand()

3. [Optional] Create a similar simulation that runs without replacement.
