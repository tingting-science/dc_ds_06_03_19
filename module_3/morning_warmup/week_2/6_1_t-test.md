### Let's run some t-tests to determine if there are differences between cars built between 1970-1976 and 1977-1982

1. Import pandas and read in auto.csv
2. Split your data into two sets, one with cars built between 1970-1976 and the other with cars built from 1977-1982 (model year column)
3. Perform a t-test to determine whether cars built before 1977 have a different mean number of cylinders than cars built from 1977 onward (use a t-test from scipy.stats)
4. What would your hypothesis be?
5. What is your t-statistic and p-value, and what do they mean?
6. Do you reject or accept the null hypothesis?
7. What are some other hypotheses that could be performed on this dataset? Try testing a couple more.
