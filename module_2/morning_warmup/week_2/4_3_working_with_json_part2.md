### We are going to continue working with the same Pokemon json file and extend our dataframe from yesterday. Use the same notebook that you completed that warmup in.

#### 4) Let's add the following information to the dataframe as separate columns: 'Type1', 'BaseStamina', 'BaseAttack', 'BaseDefense', 'PokedexHeightM'. Your final dataframe should have the Pokemon ID as the index and 6 columns of information, the pokemon name, along with the 5 previously listed columns. 

Note: If it is easier, you can create an entirely new dataframe instead of building on from step 3


#### 5) Find which Pokemon Type has the highest average BaseAttack


#### 6) Plot the top 10 Pokemon Types by highest average BaseAttack
