GET SWAPI!!!!

This morning we are going to go over some of our API fetch calls using the JSON of a classic film series: Star Wars

You will make requests from:
https://swapi.co/api

Here is the API documentation: https://swapi.co/documentation

Code the solution to answer the following questions:

1. The population of the planet Geonosis
2. The cargo capacity of the AT-ST vehicle
3. The birth year of Darth Vader
4. The eye color of the Gungan species  
BONUS: 
5. Our API indicates that Chewbacca, Han Solo, and Lando Calrissian have all piloted the Millennium Falcon at one point or another. However, there seems to be one more pilot mentioned in the API. We want to grab the name of the homeworld of the fourth pilot of the Millennium Falcon. How would we do so?
